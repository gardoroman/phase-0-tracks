## Plan for tackling jQuery in 2 hours

* Begin with Google search on "best resources to learn jQuery"
* Skim through resources and StackOverflow pages and get a sense for the best resources
* Create an outline of the things I want to learn in the next two hours
* Write goals from the outline
* Prepare and test each goal.
