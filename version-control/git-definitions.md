# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the changes that you made so you can recall later. It enables you to revert back to the previous state if there are any problems.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branch is a route of the work in progress. I would use a different route from the master branch so the master branch stays unaltered but later be merged if everything falls in place.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commit is saving your changes. A short but detailed title will be a good commit message.

* What is a merge conflict?

When a branch merged to your current branch and the changes you made conflicts with someone else's.
