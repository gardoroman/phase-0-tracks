# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is a means to track and integrate the individual changes made by one or more contributors to an item such as a document or code.
It's useful because if there are errors it easy to revert to a previous version. It is also to see at what point the errors might have been introduced

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch allows you to change code without affecting the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a save points for all files in the repo that have been stage. Useful commit messages contain a clear and brief description of the changes that have been saved.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches changed the same line(s) of code. This presents problems because Git does not know which line is valid, therefore making it necessary to resolve the merge conflict
