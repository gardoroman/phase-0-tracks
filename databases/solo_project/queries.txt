select * from band;
1|Led Zeppelin|true
2|Cold Play|false
3|Beatles|true

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

select band_name, album_name, release_date from band, album where band_id = band_id_num;
Led Zeppelin|Led Zeppelin|1969-01-12
Led Zeppelin|Houses of the Holy|1971-11-08
